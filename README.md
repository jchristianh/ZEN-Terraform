### ZEN Terraform
-----

Simple Terraform project to create a VPC, Routes, ACLs, and a Web node. Web node updates itself, and installs a few essential packages for now. At this time the Web node deployment is not flushed out, and lots of other tidying needs to be completed.


#### Run the project:
-----
```
terraform apply
```
